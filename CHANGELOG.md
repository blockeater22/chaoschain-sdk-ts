## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Added

#### Gateway Integration
- **GatewayClient**: Full Gateway service integration for workflow orchestration
  - `healthCheck()`: Check Gateway service health
  - `submitWork()`: Submit work with evidence and multi-agent attribution
  - `submitScore()`: Submit scores with commit-reveal or direct mode
  - `closeEpoch()`: Close epoch and trigger reward distribution
  - `getWorkflow()`: Get workflow status by ID
  - `listWorkflows()`: List workflows with filters
  - `waitForCompletion()`: Poll until workflow completes
- Gateway client accessible via `sdk.gateway`

#### Studio Client (Direct On-Chain Operations)
- **StudioClient**: Direct contract interaction for testing and low-level control
  - `createStudio()`: Create new Studio via ChaosCore contract
  - `registerWithStudio()`: Register agent with stake
  - `submitWork()`: Direct work submission (deprecated, use Gateway)
  - `submitWorkMultiAgent()`: Multi-agent work with contribution weights (deprecated, use Gateway)
  - `commitScore()`: Commit score hash (commit-reveal phase 1)
  - `revealScore()`: Reveal score (commit-reveal phase 2)
  - `submitScoreVector()`: Direct score submission
  - `submitScoreVectorForWorker()`: Per-worker score submission for multi-agent tasks
  - `closeEpoch()`: Close epoch via RewardsDistributor
  - `getPendingRewards()`: Check withdrawable balance
  - `withdrawRewards()`: Withdraw accumulated rewards
- Helper methods: `computeScoreCommitment()`, `encodeScoreVector()`, `generateSalt()`
- Studio client accessible via `sdk.studio`

#### Contract ABIs
- Added ChaosCore ABI for Studio creation
- Added StudioProxy ABI for agent registration, work submission, and scoring
- Added RewardsDistributor ABI for epoch management
- Added `submitScoreVector` and `submitScoreVectorForWorker` to StudioProxy ABI

#### SDK Integration
- Convenience methods on ChaosChainSDK:
  - `createStudio()`: Create new Studio
  - `registerWithStudio()`: Register with Studio
  - `getStudioPendingRewards()`: Check rewards
  - `withdrawStudioRewards()`: Withdraw rewards

  - Validation (stake, weights, contract addresses)
  - Helper methods (commitment, encoding, salt generation)
  - Commit-reveal pattern integration
  - Deprecation warnings

### Changed

## Migration Guide: 0.1.x to 0.2.0

### Using the Gateway (Recommended for Production)

```typescript
// Before: Direct contract interaction (still available but deprecated)
await sdk.studio.submitWork(studioAddress, dataHash, threadRoot, evidenceRoot);

// After: Use Gateway for production workflows
const workflow = await sdk.gateway.submitWork({
  studioAddress,
  dataHash,
  threadRoot,
  evidenceRoot,
  participants: ['0xWorker1'],
  contributionWeights: [10000],
  evidenceCid: 'bafybei...',
});
```

### Multi-Agent Work Attribution

```typescript
// Submit work with multiple contributors
await sdk.gateway.submitWork({
  studioAddress,
  dataHash,
  threadRoot,
  evidenceRoot,
  participants: ['0xWorker1', '0xWorker2'],
  contributionWeights: [6000, 4000], // Must sum to 10000 (basis points)
  evidenceCid,
});
```

### Scoring with Commit-Reveal

```typescript
// Gateway handles commit-reveal automatically
await sdk.gateway.submitScore({
  studioAddress,
  dataHash,
  scores: [85, 90, 78, 92, 88], // 5-dimensional scores
  mode: 'COMMIT_REVEAL', // or 'DIRECT'
});
```
